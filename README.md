# Object Relations Code Challenge

Welcome to Silicon Valley! For this assignment, our domain is the startup world! We have three models - `Startup`, `VentureCapitalist`, and `FundingRound`. A `Startup` has many `VentureCapitalist`s through `FundingRound`s.

If you are not sketching out your domain, and thinking about single source of truth,
you are doing it wrong :(

## Topics

- Classes vs Instances
- Variable Scope ( Class, Instance, Local )
- Object Relationships
- Arrays and Array Methods
- Class Methods

## Notes

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

**Remember!** This is a code challenge without tests. You cannot run `rspec` you cannot run `learn`. You'll need to create your own sample instances for testing purposes. Make sure your associations and methods work in the console before submitting.

## Deliverables

### Basic Class Methods and Properties

#### Build the following methods on the `Startup` class

- [x] `Startup#name`
  - returns a **string** that is the startup's name
```ruby
aviato.name
=> => "Aviato"
```
---
- [x] `Startup#founder`
  - returns a **string** that is the founder's name
  - Once a startup is created, the founder cannot be changed.
```ruby
aviato.founder
=> "Ehrlich Bachman"
```
---
- [x] `Startup#domain`
  - returns a **string** that is the startup's domain
```ruby
aviato.domain
=> "Social Media Aggregation"
```
- [x] `Startup#pivot`
  - given a string of a **domain** and a string of a **name**, change the domain
    and name of the startup. This is the only public method through which the
    domain should be changed.
```ruby
seefood.pivot("Not Hotdog", "Shazam, but for Hot Dogs")
seefood.name
"Not Hotdog"
seefood.domain
"Shazam, but for Hot Dogs"
```
---
- [x] `Startup.all`
  - should return **all** of the startup instances
```ruby
Startup.all
# while there is only one startup, this is what returns.
# revisit to add more
=> [#<Startup:0x000055ea55762a88 @name="Aviato", @domain="Social Media Aggregation", @founder="Ehrlich Bachman">]
```
---
- [x] `Startup.find_by_founder`

```
---
- [x] `Startup.domains`
  - should return an **array** of all of the different startup domains
```ruby
Startup.domains

```
---

#### Build out the following methods on the `VentureCapitalist` class

- [x] `VentureCapitalist#name`

```
- [x] `VentureCapitalist.all`
  - returns an array of all venture capitalists
```ruby
VentureCapitalist.all
=> [#<VentureCapitalist:0x000055f01bf92bb0 @name="Raviga", @total_worth=50000000>, #<VentureCapitalist:0x000055f01bf92b60 @name="Coleman Blair", @total_worth=25000000>, #<VentureCapitalist:0x000055f01bf92b10 @name="Hanneman Outdoor Media", @total_worth=2000000000>]
```
- [x] `VentureCapitalist.tres_commas_club`
  - returns an array of all venture capitalists in the TrÃ©s Commas club (they have more then 1,000,000,000 `total_worth`)

=> [#<VentureCapitalist:0x000055dfd920e608 @name="Hanneman Outdoor Media", @total_worth=2000000000>]
```

---

#### Build out the following methods on the `FundingRound` class

- [x] `FundingRound#startup`
  - returns the startup object for that given funding round
  - Once a funding round is created, I should not be able to change the startup
```ruby
hairy_question_mark.startup
=> #<Startup:0x000056398a3261c0 @name="Pied Piper", @domain="Data Compression", @founder="Richard Hendricks">
```
---
- [x] `FundingRound#venture_capitalist`
  - returns the venture capitalist object for that given funding round
  - Once a funding round is created, I should not be able to change the venture capitalist
```ruby
hairy_question_mark.venture_capitalist

```
---
- [x] `FundingRound#type`
  - returns a **string** that is the type of funding round
  - Examples include: Angel, Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C, etc.
```ruby
hairy_question_mark.type
=> "Angel"
```
- [x] `FundingRound#investment`
  - returns a **number** that is the amount invested during this funding round
  - This should be a float that is not a negative number.
```ruby
hairy_question_mark.investment

```
- [x] `FundingRound.all`
  - returns all of the funding rounds
```ruby
FundingRound.all
